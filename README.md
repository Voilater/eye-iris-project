# ATM with Iris Recognition Authentication

This project demonstrates how to integrate a simple ATM system with PIN and iris recognition authentication using OpenCV and Python. The ATM functionality includes checking balance, withdrawing, depositing, and viewing transaction history. The iris recognition authentication ensures that the user is authorized after PIN verification.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.x**
2. **OpenCV** (for webcam access and image processing)
3. **NumPy** (for matrix operations)
4. **Matplotlib** (optional for visualization)
5. **Additional Libraries**:
   - `segmentation.py` (for processing iris image)
   - `coding.py` (for encoding and comparing iris data)
   - `recognition.py` (for camera access and recognition)
   
You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. Install OpenCV and NumPy by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

If you're using the segmentation, coding, and recognition files, make sure you place them in the same directory as your main script.

### 2. Set Up Webcam Access

This project uses the webcam for iris image capture. Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and accessible.

Test if OpenCV can access your webcam using the following code:

```python
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 is the default camera ID
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Could not access the webcam.")
else:
    print("Camera accessed successfully.")
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret:
        cv2.imshow("Webcam Test", frame)
        cv2.waitKey(0)  # Wait for any key to close the window
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### 3. Save the Iris Segmentation and Coding Files

Ensure that `segmentation.py`, `coding.py`, and `recognition.py` are in the same directory as your `main.py`. These files contain the necessary functions for iris recognition and encoding.

### 4. Running the ATM Program

Once the dependencies are installed and your webcam is working, run the following command to start the ATM program:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 5. ATM Menu and Interaction

- After running the script, you'll be prompted to enter your PIN.
- If the PIN is verified successfully, the program will attempt to capture your iris image for authentication.
- If the iris matches, you'll have access to the ATM options:
  - Check Balance
  - Withdraw Money
  - Deposit Money
  - View Transaction History
  - Exit

## Iris Image Capture and Recognition Flow

1. **Capture Iris Image**: The system will use the webcam to capture an image of your eye.
2. **Iris Processing**: The captured image will be processed to extract the iris using techniques such as Hough Transform.
3. **Compare Iris**: The iris code will be compared with the stored code to authenticate the user.
4. **Authentication**: If the iris code matches, you are granted access to the ATM options. If not, the authentication fails.

### Troubleshooting Webcam Access

If you're facing issues with webcam access, consider the following:

1. Ensure no other applications are using the webcam.
2. Test the webcam using a simpler OpenCV script to verify that it's accessible.
3. Try changing the camera index (e.g., `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` instead of `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).
4. Check permissions to access the webcam (especially on Linux).

## Example of Running the Script

```bash
Enter your PIN: 1234
PIN verified successfully!
Please look at the camera for iris recognition.
Iris matched successfully.
ATM Menu:
1. Check Balance
2. Withdraw Money
3. Deposit Money
4. View Transaction History
5. Exit
Select an option: 1
Your current balance is: $1000
```
